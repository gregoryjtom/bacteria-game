#CS32 Data Structures and Algorithms Project 3#
My work:
- Designed the class inheritance hierarchy for 3 types of actors and 8 types of passive objects. Built off a GUI framework written by class instructors.
- Wrote a method that allowed non-playable bacteria actors to track and move toward the main character when within range and move randomly otherwise.
- Added health damaging and restoration functionality, as well as movement ability to actors, enabling playability of the game.
